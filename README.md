# hashtag_generator

The repository consisits of 4 files namely, deployment.py, final_model.ipynb, hashtag.ipynb and a pdf file describing my workflow for this assignment
The FINAL FILE which needs to be run is 'deployment.py'
The rest two .ipynb files are for reference alongside the Workflow to just show what I've worked upon to reach the final code consisting of the Model and the Deployment
